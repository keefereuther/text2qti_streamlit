*a) Water moves from low solute to high solute concentration
b) Water moves from high solute to low solute concentration
c) Water moves randomly without regard to solute concentration
d) Water movement is determined by temperature, not solute concentration

Title: Facilitated Diffusion vs. Active Transport
Points: 1
9. What distinguishes facilitated diffusion from active transport in cell membrane transport?

*a) Facilitated diffusion is passive; Active transport requires energy
b) Facilitated diffusion requires energy; Active transport is passive
c) Both facilitated diffusion and active transport require energy
d) Both facilitated diffusion and active transport are passive processes

Title: Bound vs. Free Ribosomes
Points: 1
10. How do bound and free ribosomes differ in terms of the destination of the proteins they synthesize?
... Bound ribosomes synthesize proteins that are incorporated into membranes or exported from the cell, while free ribosomes synthesize proteins that function within the cytosol.
*a) Bound ribosomes synthesize membrane or exported proteins; Free ribosomes synthesize proteins destined for the cytoplasm
b) Bound ribosomes synthesize proteins destined for the cytoplasm; Free ribosomes synthesize membrane proteins
c) Both bound and free ribosomes synthesize exported proteins

Title: Lysosomal Storage Disease
Points: 1
11. Lysosomal storage diseases are often the result of a specific enzyme not working, leading to an inability to break down and recycle a cellular waste product. Which of the following scenarios would likely be associated with a lysosomal storage disease?
... Lysosomal storage diseases occur when there is a deficiency in an enzyme needed to break down a specific waste product, leading to its accumulation within lysosomes. This can result in cell damage and various symptoms.
a) A deficiency in an enzyme required in the gut for sucrose digestion.
b) An overproduction of a hormone regulating blood pressure
*c) A deficiency in an enzyme required to break down a specific cellular waste product, leading to its accumulation.

Title: Regulation of Exergonic Reactions
Points: 1
12. Why don't exergonic reactions in our bodies happen quickly and spontaneously in a totally unregulated manner?

*a) They are prevented by transition states and high activation energies, that can only be lowered with enzymes.
b) They require energy input to proceed. Endergonic reactions are spontaneous.
c) They don't ever increase entropy, so it would require lots of work to get them going.

Title: Reaction Rates and Temperature or Substrate Concentration
Points: 1
13. What happens to reaction rates when you change the temperature or concentration of substrate/reactants?
... Increasing the temperature generally accelerates reaction rates by providing more kinetic energy to the molecules. Increasing the concentration of substrate or reactants often enhances the reaction rate by increasing the frequency of collisions between molecules.

Title: Fatty Acid Tails of Phospholipids and Water Interaction
Points: 1
14. Why do the fatty acid tails of phospholipids prefer not to interact with water?
... The fatty acid tails of phospholipids are hydrophobic (nonpolar) and therefore tend to avoid interaction with water, which is a polar molecule. In a bilayer, they orient inward, away from the water, minimizing their contact with it.
*a) They are hydrophobic and avoid interaction with polar water molecules
b) They form hydrogen bonds with water
c) They are hydrophilic and attract water molecules
d) They dissolve in water, leading to membrane disintegration

Points: 2
15. Explain how ATP functions in both anabolic and catabolic metabolic reactions.
